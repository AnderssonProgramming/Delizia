## Introduction

### Project Theme
Food waste in our cities and across the country has become a daily reality—even as many people go to bed hungry. **Delizia** addresses the enormous quantities of perishable food wasted by restaurants and large retail chains. Our technological platform facilitates the reuse and redistribution of food nearing expiration, helping to feed those in need while reducing economic, environmental, and social losses.

## Project Description

### The Problem
Perishable products in food establishments often go unsold, resulting in significant food waste. This not only causes economic loss but also harms the environment by contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbates social issues such as hunger.

### Opportunities
- **Excess Food Utilization:**  
  Reuse surplus food through an app, allowing companies to sell products at reduced prices using a unique "Random Menus" model.
- **Marketing for Companies:**  
  Offer advertising opportunities for surplus menus.
- **Food Waste Reduction:**  
  Reduce waste, leading to significant environmental and economic savings.
- **Aid Distribution:**  
  Improve the distribution of food to those most in need.
- **Strategic Partnerships:**  
  Forge alliances with various organizations to maximize social impact.

### Benefits
- **Food Reuse:**  
  Transform surplus perishable food into a valuable resource.
- **Economic Savings:**  
  Offer meals at reduced prices, benefiting both companies and consumers.
- **Job Creation:**  
  Generate employment in food collection, distribution, and system administration.
- **Enhanced Provider Publicity:**  
  Boost the reputation and visibility of participating companies.

### Objectives
- **Minimize Food Waste:**  
  Reduce the volume of discarded food.
- **Establish Partnerships:**  
  Collaborate with companies, restaurants, and stores for efficient management.
- **Improve Distribution:**  
  Streamline surplus redistribution.
- **Reduce Financial Losses:**  
  Help companies minimize losses from unsold perishables.
- **Donate Food:**  
  Ensure surplus food reaches vulnerable populations.

### Business Impact
- Improved corporate reputation.
- Cost reduction through fiscal incentives.
- Long-term innovation in food distribution.
- Enhanced corporate social responsibility.

### Project Scope
The project focuses solely on managing and redistributing food surplus information provided by companies. It does **not** involve physical logistics, processing, or direct food distribution.
